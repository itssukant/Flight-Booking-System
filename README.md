retrieve information and conduct transactions related to air travel.

Airline Reservation Systems. It is projected towards enhancing the
relationship between customers and airline agencies through the use
of ARSs, and thereby making it convenient for the customers to book
the flights as when they require such that they can utilize this
software to make reservations. This software has two parts. First is
user part and the administrator part. User part is used as a front end
and administrator is the back end. Administrator is used by airline
authority. It will allow the customers to access database and allow
new customers to sign up for online access. The system allows the
airline passenger to search for flights that are available between the
two travel cities, namely the “Departure city” and “Arrival city” for a
particular departure and arrival dates. The system displays all the
flight’s details such as flight no, name, price and duration of journey
etc. After search the system display list of available flights and allows
customer to choose a particular flight. Then the system checks for
the availability of seats on the flight. If the seats are available then
the system allows the passenger to book a seat. Otherwise it asksthe
user to choose another flight. To book a flight the system asks the
customer to enter his details such as name, address, city, state, and
credit card number and contact number. Then it checks the validity
of card and book the flight and update the airline database and user
database. The system also allows the customer to cancel his/her
reservation, if any problem occurs. The main purpose of this
software is to reduce the manual errors involved in the airline
reservation process and make it convenient for the customers to
book the flights as when they require such that they can utilize this
software to make reservations, modify reservations or cancel a
particular reservation.
